The [Elixir meetup in Toronto](https://www.meetup.com/TorontoElixir/)
has been going strong for a while so it was about time that we started
gathering meeting notes and local news on a proper site.

This site is collaboratively maintained on
[Github](https://github.com/elixirtoronto/elixirtoronto),
and the best way to add content therefore is by filing a
pull request and then hopping on the [Elixir #toronto Slack
channel](https://elixir-lang.slack.com/messages/C0SSJT1TK/).

The main purpose of this site is meeting notes, but depending on the
situation other local news can be posted as well.

If there are any issues with the site, feel free to open an issue in GH
or pop by in #toronto on Slack.
